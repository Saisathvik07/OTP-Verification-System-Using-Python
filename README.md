# OTP-Verification-System-Using-Python

A secure and reliable OTP (One-Time Password) Verification System built using Python. This project automates the process of generating and sending OTPs to users via email for verification purposes, ensuring secure user authentication.

Features:

Generates a 6-digit OTP randomly for each verification session.

Implements email automation using the SMTP library to send OTPs to users.

Includes real-time OTP validation with expiration logic for enhanced security.

Features error handling to manage invalid inputs and expired OTPs gracefully.

Designed for scalability and easy integration with web or mobile applications.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: smtplib, email.message, hashlib, time, random

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook, VS Code

How It Works:

The system generates a unique OTP and sends it to the user's email address.

The user inputs the received OTP into the system.

The system verifies the entered OTP against the original and checks its validity (e.g., expiration time).

If the OTP matches and is valid, the user is authenticated successfully.

Applications:

User authentication for secure login systems.

Payment gateway verification processes.

Account recovery and password reset workflows.

Repository Highlights:

Code Simplicity: Clear and concise implementation, making it beginner-friendly.

Scalable Design: Easily extendable for integration into larger projects.

Documentation: Includes step-by-step instructions and inline comments for better understanding.
